          Hello everyone my name is Nik Arboleda and I am an aspiring programmer and developer. Creating websites has always been a hobby of mine, though I mostly ever used platforms like wordpress, shopify, and clickfunnels - now being able to
          manipulate sites using programming tools I've only ever vaguely ever heard about is oddly satisfying. I hope to create immersive and substantive websites and applications to be able to provide me an extraordinarily lavish lifestyle filled
          with fame and fortune. Well, fortune mostly I particularly enjoy my privacy, so fame maybe not so much. If you'd like me to create a thing involving stuff on the internets, just pay me and I will get it done for you - no problem. Feel free
          to contact me on the contact me form and I will bill you as quickly as I can, thank you for your time.
        </p>
